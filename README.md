# Complex Number Algebra
This is a Python implementation for a program that can perform algebraic operations on complex numbers such as
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- negation
- inverse

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
